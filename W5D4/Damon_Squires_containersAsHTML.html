    <h2 id="description">Description</h2>
    <p>
      Grilled Cheese is a hot sandwich made with one or more varieties of cheeses. It is typically prepared by heating cheese between slices of bread with a cooking fat such as butter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cheese dream, an open-faced grilled cheese sandwich, became popular in the U.S. during the Great Depression.[1] U.S. government cookbooks describe Navy cooks broiling "American cheese filling sandwiches" during World War II.
